# ELECTRIC VEHICLE ENERGY Coin - EVE Coin is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin frameworks.  

*What is EVE COIN?*
The project goal for Electric Energy Coin - EVE COIN is to provide a Cryptocurrency representing Electric Vehicle Energy to pay for Electric Vehicle charging by electric vehicle owners. 

As the world moves away from fossil fuels and adopts Electric and alternative engergy to power Vehicles, a cryptocurrency will be needed by consumers to pay for energy consumed at electric vehicle charging stations.

At present, it costs on average $.22 per kilowatt hour to charge eletric vehicles in North America at consumer charge stations. The price/value for each EVE Coin would be based on that price as an energy derivitive store of value.
